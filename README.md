# Neural network from scratch
Implementation of neural networks from scratch - no machine learning libraries, only numpy and math. This project offers a deep dive into the core principles of neural computation through a hands-on, educational approach. The main purpose is to understand in low level detail how backpropagation and neural networks work. As the code does not use tensors and therefore is not optimized to run in paralel on GPU, it migh be quite slow for larger networks.
